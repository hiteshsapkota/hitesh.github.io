I am 6th year PhD candidate in Computing and Information Sciences working with [Prof. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/qyuvks-qi-yu) at [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing](https://www.rit.edu/mining/) lab. I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern in [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) during summer 2021 and 2022. Prior to pursuing PhD, I completed my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Institute Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Nepal.

#### **Research Overview**
My research includes Video Anomaly Detection by developing weakly supervised and active learning techniques. Also, I have been working on openset detection under imbalanced class, few shot learning, and spurious correlation/biased setting by leveraging the concepts of Evidential learning and Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). 

#### **Research Interests**
Reinforcement Learning, Multiple Instance Learning, Distributionally Robust Optimization, Active Learning, Anomaly Detection, Openset Detection, Fairness AI.
