I am an Applied Scientist II at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) under the Hardware-Product Integrity team. Prior to joining Amazon, I was a PhD student at RIT working with [Prof. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/qyuvks-qi-yu) within the [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing](https://www.rit.edu/mining/) lab. Also, I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern in [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) during summer 2021 and 2022.  I completed my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Institute Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Nepal.

#### **Research Overview**
My research includes: (a) Developing Robust Weakly-Supervised learning techniques to  tackle crucial real-world problems like anomaly detection, cancerous tissue detection etc., (b)  Making overparameterized models like DNNs sparse, unbiased, and better calibrated by leveraging advanced techniques like Distributionally Robust Optimization, (c)  Making LLM and Multimodal machine learning models  uncertainty aware, sparse, and fair.

#### **Research Interests**
Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Generative AI, Large Language Model, Visual Question Answering Anomaly Detection,  Sparse Learning, Adversarial Learning.
